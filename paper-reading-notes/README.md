# Paper Reading Notes

A systematic collection of research paper summaries, key insights, and practical applications in statistics, machine learning, and quantitative finance.

## üìö Overview

This section contains detailed notes from academic papers, with each paper paired with a corresponding hands-on experiment. The structure ensures:

- **One-to-One Mapping**: Each paper has a dedicated experiment that demonstrates its concepts
- **Practical Implementation**: Every theoretical concept is validated through code and data
- **Learning by Doing**: Readers can immediately apply paper insights through experiments
- **Reproducible Research**: All experiments include complete code and data for replication
